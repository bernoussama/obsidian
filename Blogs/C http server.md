The video provides a detailed account of building an HTTP server in C using the CodeCrafters platform. Below is the transcript and a sectioned summary of the video:

## Transcript

[00:00] a few days ago a company called code Crafters messaged me and asked me hey would you like to try

[00:04] our coding platform and I said yeah good why not so today I'll be putting myself through all circles of

[00:09] help to make my own server in Plame seat that's right now C++ we don't need classes or stupid ass

[00:14] synx just good allc now this is a sponsored video but I'll be doing my best to express my opinions

[00:19] about the platform so if you want to try code crafter by yourself there's an affiliate Link in the description

[00:23] and depending on when you watch the video there will be a new free challenge each week for you to

[00:28] try.

[00:30] okay so after setting up the project I realized that there was a lot of placeholder code that I just

[00:34] didn't understand I'm somewhat familiar with C but I've never programmed networking with it so I spend 4 hours reading

[00:39] about every function I could find and commenting every single line of code at this point I just have some

[00:44] simple code that creates a circuit binds the circuit to a port and then waits for incoming connections and with

[00:50] all that done I'm ready for the real first step in this whole process respond with 200 now for those

[00:55] of you who don't speak HTTP this just means that we'll be sending a text message to our server.

[01:00] and if our request is successfully processed by it we will get this as an answer pretty straightforward right so

[01:05] all I have to do is to format my response like this with the appropriate serial of Serial whatever this

[01:11] thing is otherwise the world's going to end or something and send the response with this function appropriately named sand

[01:17] and after doing that we push our code and all the tests should pass yay let's continue step one was

[01:24] pretty simple just a warm up now step two is still pretty simple all we got to do now is

[01:29] respond with.

[01:29] 44 if the path is any other than the root so for example if I try to access the root

[01:34] I should get 100 but if I try to access fuck you bitch which is not defined I should get

[01:39] 404 to do this we just have to BSE the bath again using this function here that I'm not going

[01:44] to try to pronounce and check if the path is either home or something else and that's it step three

[01:50] is when things start to become a bit problematic you see our task now is to pors the paath from

[01:55] the HTTP request that will contain a random string and attach that string to the body.

[02:00] of the response so we need to keep track of both the path that we're checking and the string that

[02:04] we want to Echo but because working with strings and C is so stupidly complicated we have to be very

[02:08] careful with the pointers and all that stupid shit with that done we should be able to get this now

[02:15] following our previous steps we have to continue parsing Stu as you can see in my Sur is just a

[02:19] bunch of parsing being held together by poorly written code whatever for this step we have to get the user

[02:25] agent from the request header parse it and then respond with it whenever the user.

[02:29] accesses the URL user agent now user agent is just a header that allows the server to identify the application

[02:35] that trying to access it I'm not going to lie I had no idea how to proceed with this step

[02:39] so I decided to look at the guide that the side offers now here's the thing code Crafters has guides

[02:43] for a bunch of different programming languages however C is what you might call an experimental feature which means that

[02:51] these guides might not always be fully accurate or they might just simply be wrong with that mention I have

[02:56] to say that it was actually quite useful it's not 100% right you still have to.

[02:59] some research in order to understand what you need to do but come on things can't be so easy especially

[03:05] easy anyway all we got to do now is to fucking porch more things until I get the desire parameters

[03:09] that I need for the response and Tada now we correctly respond with the user agent that descent the request

[03:17] the fuck did I just say now we correctly respond with the user agent that sent the request if you

[03:22] have ever thought about how the enget works you might have noticed that a server that just responds to one

[03:27] connection is not very useful therefore.

[03:30] we need to introduce concurrency and I have no fucking clue how to do this so I think I look

[03:34] at all the code EXs yeah so apparently everyone here is a fucking try hard and they make stupidly complicated

[03:39] code so I just don't get any of this but whatever anyway after trying for a few hours to understand

[03:46] multi-threading I gave up but I saw this guy's code that uses Fork to create sub processes to account for

[03:52] currency so don't mind if I do okay done next step the final two Circles of.

[03:59] the server H involve raing and posting files to the server why in that order I don't know to me

[04:05] it makes more sense to post the file first and then program the logic to read it but whatever so

[04:09] here's what I will do first to post the file we just got to make sure that again we're in

[04:12] the correct path by doing a cringe amount of manual foring see I thought this project was going to be

[04:17] more interesting to Showcase but it's like 90% parsing at this point I know some snarky programmers in the comments

[04:21] are going to be like hey but you could just like make a function to PST the data and use

[04:25] a while loop and you don't have toah blah blah shut the fuck up I don't care this is not

[04:28] Java and then we just have.

[04:29] to open the file and write the content and that's it now for reading the file we have to do

[04:33] the same thing but instead of opening the file and writing the content we just have to open the file

[04:38] and reading the cont it also sounds super stupid when you say it like that but it's actually pretty simple

[04:41] it's just 10 lines of code now we can test our server by sending this request that will create a

[04:47] file and now if I try to get the file it should appear on my screen and I downloaded it

[04:53] huh I wasn't expecting that whatever we managed to successfully create a server in playing C.

[04:59] no extensions no third party libraries not a single neuron working in this brain we can post data we can

[05:05] get data and we can that's all we can do it for now it's pretty prary but it's something and

[05:11] that's pretty much it I struggled way more than I showed case with the video because it would not be

[05:15] fun to tell you how I spent 4 hours reading documentation just to solve stupid bug but nonetheless I really

[05:20] enjoyed coding this and it was especially helpful since I'm having an embed systems course now and I had to

[05:24] refresh my c knowled a bit so don't forget to try code crafters and use my affiliate link if you

[05:28] want to I really like.

[05:29] the side and they're working on adding more challenges in the near future so it all looks very interesting for

[05:34] now and if you made it this far thanks again for watching the video.

## Summary of the Video Sections:

The video details the creator's experience building an HTTP server in plain C using the CodeCrafters platform.

- **Introduction to CodeCrafters and Project Setup** [[00:00](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLplqoB04hE&t=0)]: The video begins with the creator introducing CodeCrafters, a coding platform that sponsored the video. He outlines his goal: to build an HTTP server in C. He also mentions the availability of an affiliate link and weekly free challenges on the platform.
- **Initial Server Setup and First Challenge (Respond with 200)** [[00:30](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLplqoB04hE&t=30)]: The creator describes spending four hours understanding placeholder C networking code. He sets up basic server functionality to create and bind a socket, then proceeds to the first challenge: responding with an HTTP 200 status code for successful requests.
- **Second Challenge (Respond with 404)** [[01:24](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLplqoB04hE&t=84)]: The second step involves implementing logic to respond with an HTTP 404 status code if the requested path is not the root. This requires parsing the incoming request path.
- **Third Challenge (Parsing Path and Echoing String)** [[01:50](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLplqoB04hE&t=110)]: This section introduces more complexity, requiring the server to parse a random string from the HTTP request path and include it in the response body. The creator highlights the difficulties of string manipulation in C.
- **Fourth Challenge (Parsing User-Agent Header)** [[02:15](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLplqoB04hE&t=135)]: The task here is to extract the 'User-Agent' header from the request and respond with it when a specific URL is accessed. The creator admits to struggling with this step and consults CodeCrafters' guides, noting that the C guides are experimental and may require additional research.
- **Implementing Concurrency with Fork** [[03:22](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLplqoB04hE&t=202)]: Recognizing that a single-connection server is impractical, the creator addresses concurrency. He initially struggles with multi-threading but finds a solution by using `fork` to create sub-processes, borrowing an idea from another user's code.
- **File Operations: Posting and Reading Files** [[03:59](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLplqoB04hE&t=239)]: The final stages involve adding functionality to post and read files on the server. The creator explains the process of checking the correct path, opening, and writing file content for posting, and then opening and reading file content for retrieval. He notes the repetitive nature of parsing in the project.
- **Conclusion and Reflection** [[04:53](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLplqoB04hE&t=293)]: The creator successfully builds a basic C HTTP server without external libraries. He reflects on the significant challenges, particularly the time spent on documentation for bug fixing, but expresses enjoyment and how the project helped refresh his C knowledge for an embedded systems course. He encourages viewers to try CodeCrafters.
